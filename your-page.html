<p>Hi, my name is Tim.  This is what very well may be a disatruous attempt at me making a quick website and pushing it to gitHub (on a 20 minute timeline) with a tenouous grasp on HTML and Git. Regardless of the outcome, I will work hard to fix my mistakes as I enjoy this process, problems, conflicts, failures, and all.</p>
